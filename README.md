# Calculator_Project

Creating a simple calculator with HTML and CSS is an excellent beginner project to practice structuring and styling web elements. This guide will walk you through designing the basic interface for a calculator using HTML to create the structure and CSS for styling.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Setting Up the HTML Structure

The HTML file will form the basic structure of our calculator with a display area and buttons for numbers, operations, and functions.

Create an HTML File:
Name the file index.html.

Add Basic HTML Elements:
Open the file and start by adding a DOCTYPE declaration, setting the documentâ€™s language, and creating the base structure.
Use a div with the class calculator to wrap all the elements.
Add another div with the class display to show the current number or calculation result.
Add buttons for numbers (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), decimal (.), clear (C), and equal (=).

Step 2: Styling with CSS
The CSS will make the calculator visually appealing and functional.

Create a CSS File:
Name the file style.css.

Style the Calculator Layout:
Use a flexbox to center the calculator on the page.
Style the calculator container, display, and button elements.
Set the display font, button sizes, colors, and add some hover effects for a better user experience.
